        # - host-annotator that populates the k8s node object with approprite annotations
        #     - report back information such as:
        #         - vminfra-bridge ip address as label to k8s node
        #         - sushy-tools ip endpoint for BMC control
        # - vino-builder (ansible) that that consumes the `ConfigMap` that contains everything necessary for libvirt to define the virtual machines and networks on the host and does both green-field generation of VM resources and understands if the `ConfigMap` changed and will handle those lifecycle updates.  There is no need to stage or coordinate changes to these `ConfigMap` resources as they will result in a no-op `virsh update` which only take effect with a VM stop/start.
        #     - do the following (assumption is all of this is idempotent for day 2):
        #         - interogate host
        #             - prevalidate (is kvm loaded, etc)
        #             - define host facts (eg cpu list, vf list, etc)
        #         - interogate existing vms or state recording somewhere
        #             - collect resources in use
        #                 - what cores are in use
        #                 - what vfs are in use
        #                 - memory in use
        #         - define libvirt networks
        #         - define libvirt storage pools
        #         - ensure appropriate qcows exist
        #         - define libvirt domains
        #             - ensure mem/cpu aligned in one numa
        #         - new domain validation (only on new domains):
        #             - do a simple domain start/destroy test via redfish.
        #             - wait for dhcp req on admin interface?
